                <p>
                    This week, we all got together to discuss possible ideas. In class, we've been working on the
                    various tutorials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The code we wrote this week was for this website and for the tutorials we did in class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Originally, we thought of doing some kind of game-like simulation, but we weren't able to come up
                    with a clear direction on the purpose of the simulation. Right now, our idea is to build a
                    conversation tool that displays chat bubbles over people's heads as they speak and records the
                    conversation text. It would use speech-to-text tech and the built-in
                    microphones to figure out where words are coming from. This would be useful for people who need
                    clear transcriptions of speech. For example, it could benefit people with impaired hearing, people
                    who don't speak a language natively, or people in business meetings who want a log of the
                    conversation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next week, we will prepare our team pitch and figure out what resources and assets we need to make
                    this project a reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, we're not stuck on anything. We're excitedly waiting to finish our pitch so we can
                    start doing real work on our project!
                </p>
