            This week, we tested different Speech-To-Text APIs including Microsoft Azure, Amazon Transcribe, 
            and Google Cloud. We tested them out by using our phone as a microphone since we haven't bought
            a proper one yet. At first, we thought that the room was too loud to pick up the exact words 
            we're saying and it made us think about how when we demo our final product on our demo day,
            it might have the same amount of noise. After some trial and error, we found out that it only works
            for .flac audio files. In the example, they provided a .flac file which worked pretty well. We
            learned that we have to convert our mp3 file to a .flac file so that it is compatible with it. 
            We decided to use Google's Cloud Speech-to-Text API because it supports widest 
            variety of languages and contains different feature that we found useful. Some of which includes
            the language detection and multispeaker content.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our current plan for next week is to order some wireless clip-on microphones so that we can test and
            we also want to get the Speech-To-Text API up and running on the Magic Leap.

        <p>
          This week, we gave our project pitch in class where we talked about the problem
          we are addressing with our product, the technologies that we are planning to use,
          and a timeline of what we plan to accomplish each week. Aditya suggested that we
          use the spatial mapping mesh to physically drop the chat bubble if we were unable
          to use cameras to find some unique marker. After class, we decided to get microphones
          so that we can have more options than just relying on our devices' microphones.
        </p>
        <p>
          We completed our Product Requirements Document (PRD), which details our
          project plan with deliverables, features, performance metrics, milestones,
          responsibilities of each team member, materials and budget, risks, and how
          risks will be addressed. This can be found at the top of the 'Home' tab.
        </p>
        <p>
          We worked on the slides and PRD as a group. In the lab session, we set up
          the Magic Leap and ran into some trouble when working through the guides. We
          eventually got this cleared up and learned that we could only run our applications
          on two of the 4 computers we were given because the Magic Leap is a very
          resource-intensive device. We learned what we needed to do with the Magic Leap and
          that we needed to update it when it's charged so that it can run the applications
          we built using Unity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our current plan for next week is to have Ron and Laurissa test out different APIs
          for speech-to-text translation and have James and Andrew display some readable
          text on the Magic Leap.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the problems that we faced this week is that the Magic Leap gets very hot, but
          Alan told us that we should probably just close all the applications when it's not
          being used in order to make it less likely to overheat. This may prove to make the
          device less user-friendly, since people probably don't want something hot on their
          heads, so we're wondering how other people who develop on the Magic Leap deal with this.

        </div>

        <p>
          This week, we all got together to discuss possible ideas. In class,
          we've been working on the various tutorials. We also all worked
          together on the website and project proposal.
        </p>
        <p>
          The code we wrote this week was for this website and for the
          tutorials we did in class.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally, we thought of doing some kind of game-like simulation,
          but we weren't able to come up with a clear direction on the purpose
          of the simulation. Right now, our idea is to build a conversation
          tool that displays chat bubbles over people's heads as they speak
          and records the conversation text. It would use speech-to-text tech
          and the built-in microphones to figure out where words are coming
          from. This would be useful for people who need clear transcriptions
          of speech. For example, it could benefit people with impaired
          hearing, people who don't speak a language natively, or people in
          business meetings who want a log of the conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next week, we will prepare our team pitch and figure out what
          resources and assets we need to make this project a reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, we're not stuck on anything. We're excitedly waiting to
          finish our pitch so we can start doing real work on our project!
        </p>
